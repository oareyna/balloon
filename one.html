        <h2>
        Two Seeds</h2>

        Two seeds lay in the soil
        one of a Buttercup 
        And another of a pink Azalea
        Both growing and grasping to be complete
        The Buttercup  wants to be the best
        Its ancestors were strong and were never wavering for less
        The Buttercup  wanted to be just like them
        The Buttercup  wanted to consume a lot of water so it would be the strongest and most powerful
        It had plenty of water
        But that wasn't enough
        It needed more
        So anytime it felt a root around it
        It would the tear the roots out 
        Break them, and terrorize them
        Making sure nothing but itself would get water so it would be the strongest
        The Azalea was quite different 
        The Azalea wanted to be humble
        It's ancestors always tried to give back, and be complete in knowing that the flowers around it were strong and bright
        So the Azalea tried to be small, and grabbing only the water it needed
        Anytime the Azalea saw another root, it would try and become even smaller
        Both the Buttercup  and pink Azalea now have their stems
        They are now trying to have strong buds
        The Buttercup  has a strong desire
        It can't overcome it so when the sun comes out 
        it has to be the tallest and it has to be the only one that the sun can see
        If there was another flower beside, it can't help but break it's stem
        The Azalea on the other hand can't help but cower
        Even if there are no flowers beside it 
        It acts like it has a hunch back 
        The Buttercup  now is in full bloom 
        It now is believed to be the best
        It believes that it truly is the most fragrant and magnificent until one night
        The moon was truly glowing
        And unfortunately the Buttercup  saw a flower that looked so delicate yet so beautiful
        It couldn't help but but be jealous and infuriated 
        When it went closer to the pink Azalea, the pink Azalea thought it saw something so sturdy and bewitching
        The Azalea wanted nothing more than to be friends with such a lovely flower 
        The Buttercup  didn't have such thoughts
        When the sun came up at once, the pink Azalea thought to give a piece of its pedal as a gift
        But when it gave it to the Buttercup , it ripped up the pedal at once
        The Azalea was heart broken
        So the Azalea went next to river to think
        Maybe the Buttercup  wasn't in a great mood
        Maybe the Azalea was too pushy 
        So the Azalea thought to give the Buttercup  some space
        As night came the Buttercup  was upset
        How can something be beautiful but weak
        The Buttercup  thought that the Azalea was weak for showing such giving
        The Buttercup  decided to go to the river
        When it saw the Azalea it didn't know what to do
        But before the Buttercup  could do anything the Azalea asked
        "Do you want to lay near the river?"
        Then the Buttercup  said
        "I will lay, if I want"
        The Buttercup  would come days after that 
        Laying right near the azalea
        When the Azalea seemed to be so delicate, all of the Buttercup s impure intentions seemed to go away
        It would seem to be a good match
        Because the Azalea would try to be as small as possible, and the Buttercup  would try to spread its roots to be as big as possible
        The mood seemed to have turned bright until one night
        one night, there came a disease
        No one knew how it came but it came and it was strong
        While the Buttercup  was fine, the Azalea was everything but
        While the Azalea always tried to be small in consideration of other flowers, and always trying to be humble
        Its roots started to grasp for more water
        So its roots started to spread a little farther
        There was enough water
        But the Buttercup  couldn't handle it 
        The needing to be the one in power, and the needing to be the best was too great
        The Azalea gave the Buttercup  another piece of its pedal but this time it was extremely fragile and seemed very withered
        While the Azalea didn't know anything, the Azalea seemed to be forgiving
        If the Buttercup  cup wanted to anything,it needed to do it now
        The Buttercup  broke the Azalea's stem
        Everything bright and delicate seemed to be done in this lifetime
        The Buttercup didn't falter
        It stood upright as if it did no wrong
        As if it didn't take the light from the world
        As the next day came, the Buttercup  treated it like the day before was never there

        <h2>
        Another Quiver</h2>

        The push in your voice
        You screaming in pain but keep the words flowing
        It takes everything in me to not scream “Stop”
        Because I can't take it no more
        If I hear another quiver
        No amount drains would be able to contain
        The streams that would thrash
        And the seas that would cry from 
        The influx of rips and shreds
        From its very foundation
        That was meant to never waver
        Only able to silence the ripples
        By knowing it would only make more quivers and lasting cinders
        Life blooms daffodils and sparks the pedals into the morning sun, cultivates the chirps of soft spoken parakeets, soothes the summer with splashes swimming through the land
        But even more, life is full of spontaneity 
        Even if you ask for it or not
        It could cool your wounds or just completely grab the tiniest needle and start peeling back up your scabs
        That were finally a nice pale pink
        No sight of what is you or the dirt we step on
        What is life built out of?
        Is it greatness, or just complex breathing?
        “We think, therefore we are”
        Or do we just simply think too much, and create meaning out of the leaves that spin out of cycle, the stars that happen to perfectly align, the numbers that just seem bound to be around
        They don't mean anything of importance, but beings are so insecure, and live with a paradox of choices
        That nothing suddenly has to mean something in your world of just complex inhaling
        I can hardly see the morning dew, the deers galloping, the fish skipping, the stems inching, or the leaves swaying
        Because all I hear is life grasping for oxygen that will never meet
        What is there to see, when beauty is whimpering, clawing, raking, and woefully hoping?
        The bloom never came
        It never seized its sight
        Not even a breath
        And too many quivers
        <hr>
        <h2>
        To be</h2>

        Is our eyes of the same cloth
        Do our stars make constellations
        Can our sediments make rocks
        If our twigs yearn to be
        Will there be branches?
        Thousands of leaves 
        With thousands of thoughts
        Will one even wither for … 
        Wither for me?
        If not, let me be
        Not of resemblance
        Of the moon that laces light with the sun
        Or
        The nodes that fade into ashes for the stout stem
        Let me be
        Of the essence of a phoenix
        A phoenix without its redemption  
        A phoenix with an end
